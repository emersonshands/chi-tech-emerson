 * ## General Concepts
 *
 * A volume mesher generates cells (chi_mesh::Cell) which can be
 * either 2D polygons (chi_mesh::CellPolygon) or 3D polyhedrons
 * (chi_mesh::CellPolyhedron). All cell objects are pushed into
 * a vector located in a chi_mesh::MeshContinuum after creation.
 * Right now only a single continuum can be operated on and this is normally
 * by means of attaching a region to a solver. \n
 *
 * \n
 * Right now 2D meshes can be partitioned but the full 2D cell geometry
 * exists on each processor. This is mostly because of the way the extruder
 * works. This means that for a 2D problem a continuum will have ALL of the
 * cells (as fully defined cells), in every process, in the member
 * vector "cells" of the continuum.
 * The same can not be said for 3D extruded meshes where each process has all
 * the nodes but if cells are not local then only placeholders are uploaded.
 * Placeholders are basically the base class chi_mesh::Cell and contains only
 * the cell's partition_id and its centroid. The concept that these placeholders
 * are uploaded allows a sweeping order to figure out dependencies. A similar
 * strategy would have to be devised for using third-party meshes.\n
 *
 * \n
 * Global mesh references are maintained in chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::cells.
 * This contains the actual mesh object. Local indices are stored in
 * chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::local_cell_glob_indices and are the global indices
 * of local cells. Conversely the local indices, given a global index,
 * are stored in chi_mesh::MeshContinuum::glob_cell_local_indices.
