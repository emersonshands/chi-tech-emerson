/** \defgroup LuaModules F Code modules

Modules are intended to be code segments that perform unique operations and
functions. In general, the ChiMath, ChiMesh and other utilities should serve
most of the needs of the modules and where appropriate functionalities of
some modules can eventually be incorporated into the utilities category.

An additional function of modules is to allow us to segregate open source
 modules from export controlled or classified software.
