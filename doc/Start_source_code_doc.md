# Documentation

1. The preferred method of accessing the documentation is to clone the repo and
build the doxygen-based documentation. See the [Compilation and run instructions](./Start_install.md)
2. However, the documentation is also periodically updated online at [https://chi-tech.github.io](https://chi-tech.github.io)
