Most of the DFEM diffusion test-cases are identical to the CFEM test-cases.
Refer to the `CFEM Diffusion Test-cases as Tutorial` page.

One additional example may be of interest:
3. **[DFEM_Diffusion_2D_3b_analytical_coef_L2_error](https://github.com/chi-tech/chi-tech/blob/development/tests/DFEM_StandAloneDiffusion_2D_square_analytical_coef2_L2err.lua)**
   - *description:* method of manufactured solution for a diffusion-reaction
   problem with space-dependent material properties
   - *feature of potential interest:*
         - use of the analytical solution to compute the L2 error norm.
